# OWELIA - Ovarian Wellness & Early Learning AI
Prediction of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Using Optimized Machine Learning Classifiers
## Introduction

**Problem Statement**: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder affecting individuals of reproductive age, often leading to complications like irregular periods, infertility, metabolic issues and the most common cause of anovulatory infertility; ∼90–95% of anovulatory women seeking treatment for infertility have PCOS. So, an early detection of PCOS can help in timely medical intervention and lifestyle management.

**Solution**: OWELIA, a specially trained AI model leverages machine learning techniques to develop an early stage detection of PCOS using medical and lifestyle data. By analyzing key health indicators, the model aims to provide an efficient and data-driven approach to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing PCOS accurately.

## How PCOS changes one's life!!!
### My Life with PCOS: A Real-Life Story, The National Infertility Association article, September 16, 2019
**Sasha Ottey is the founder and executive director of PCOS Challenge: The National Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Association, the leading patient support and advocacy organisation for women and girls with PCOS**, sharing how once she got diagnosed with PCOS after two decades of having it, 
I was diagnosed with PCOS in my late 20s after missing a period and visiting my ObGYN. Despite clear symptoms since adolescence, my diagnosis was delayed due to lack of awareness and missed opportunities by healthcare providers. My doctors offered little guidance—one dismissing my irregular periods and another advising weight loss without support. Frustrated and left to manage on my own.
After doing research, I found out that I had been experiencing PCOS symptoms such as hair loss and weight gain since adolescence. Looking back at my history, I found that there were many missed opportunities for an earlier diagnosis, but due to my own lack of awareness about PCOS, and various specialists not asking the right questions, I was diagnosed almost two decades after the onset of symptoms.
